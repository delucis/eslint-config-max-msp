# Contributing

If you think something is missing, have spotted a bug, or would like to propose some changes, excellent! Thank you! Anyone and everyone is welcome, just please note [the code of conduct][COC].

## 🐛 Yowza, this is broken! 🐛

If you found a bug I lovingly coaxed from its chrysalis, please gently liberate it via the nearest window. 👐

You can either:

- [open an issue][newissue], letting me know the bug exists; or
- open a pull request, proposing changes that will fix the bug.

## ✨ Pushmi-pullyu ✨

If you would like to submit a pull request, here are some suggested steps to follow:

1. Create your own fork of this repository
2. Create a branch for your shiny new doodad, e.g. called `shiny-new-doodad`
3. Commit your changes to your branch
4. Open a pull request
5. Drink that carrot juice you’ve been saving for a special moment. 🐰 🎉

If you’re not sure about the thing you want to propose and would like to chat before going all in and working on it, [open an issue][newissue] and we can hash it out together. 💕
